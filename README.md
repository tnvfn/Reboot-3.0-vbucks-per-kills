## IMPORTANT
This is not my code, and it is just TheRevisitors Vbucks per kill code. Reason i'll put this here is, because some kids had came to my dms asking how to put Revisitors code to reboot.

## How to use?

I will give simple tutorial:
Go to file named "FortPlayerController.cpp"
On that file do Ctrl + F
search this "std::string apiKey = "ur-api-key";"
Change the API key to yours!
Remember to have same API key on Reload backend config & gs.

I will probably update this and add some features so if you use Credit me (tnv) and TheRevisitor Please.
